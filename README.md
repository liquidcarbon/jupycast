Think about all the notebooks you and I have started that never saw the light of day.

To publish a computational notebook, at least three decisions must be made:

1. Decision to publish your work, either to the public web, or to your org's intranet.
2. Choice of destination, tools, and formats.
3. Determination that a given notebook is ready to go out (every time, for each notebook).

This repo is a collection of tools and recipes that help reduce and eliminate these decision barriers, so that valuable work can be published and discovered.
